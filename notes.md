# Details

- Prop's 7 Characters
    - The villain
        - an evil character that creates struggles for the hero.
    - The dispatcher
        — any character who illustrates the need for the hero's quest and sends the hero off. This often overlaps with the princess's father.
    - The helper
        — a typically magical entity that comes to help the hero in their quest.
    - The princess or prize, and often her father
        — the hero deserves her throughout the story but is unable to marry her as a consequence of some evil or injustice, perhaps the work of the villain. The hero's journey is often ended when he marries the princess, which constitutes the villain's defeat.
    - The donor
        — a character that prepares the hero or gives the hero some magical object, sometimes after testing them.
    - The hero
        — the character who reacts to the dispatcher and donor characters, thwarts the villain, resolves any lacking or wronghoods and weds the princess.
    - The false hero
        — a Miles Gloriosus figure who takes credit for the hero's actions or tries to marry the princess.[6]
