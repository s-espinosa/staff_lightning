# The Power of Myth

*Moyers:* Unlike heroes such as Prometheus or Jesus, we're not going on our journey to save the world but to save ourselves.
*Campbell:* But in doing that you save the world. The influence of a vital person vitalizes, there's no doubt about it. The world without spirit is a wasteland.
